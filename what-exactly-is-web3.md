#### What exactly is Web3

If you pay close attention, web3 combines elements of web1 and web2. It supports user-generated content and is decentralized like Web1 and Web2, respectively:

The term web3 was first coined by Gavin Wood (@gavofyork), the Ethereum co-founder.

The web was opened in the first iteration because there were no social sites and mobile devices.

Users were just able to read without being able to create anything on the internet.

With the evolvement of social sites and UX things, web gets closed.

Everyone has a mobile device in their hand. Accessing social sites and generating content on the internet is easy as a cakewalk.

Everyone loves social sites. So is there any problem with web2?

Laypersons don't have any problem with web2. They don't even know and care.

But if you think deeply, you will find that social sites provider entice you by offering unique functionalities and then commercializing your data.

It's a high-level problem where 99% of people don't even care.

My parents genuinely have no objections to WhatsApp selling their contact numbers and serving pertinent adverts.

Even they would be happier because they will get good recommendations without much sourcing for anything.

But it's a problem for elite people because we're governed by a centralized entity.

We are not owing the data we are generated on the internet.

This is where web3 comes in.

Web3 is based on decentralization like web1 but has the modern functionalities of web2.

You can actually create content on the internet and own it without much worrying about commercialization and stuff.

Tokens allow us to buy things on the Internet and the transaction of which remains on the blockchain.

Blockchain operates on the peer-to-peer network hence not owned by a single entity. Which makes it fully transparent and anybody within the network can access it.

So everything is solved? Nope.

Decentralization is the core component of web3 and hence everyone is chasing it.

The real problem we got in web3 is complicated User Experience.

By following a single YouTube video, a student may learn HTML and CSS and create a website overnight.

We can create content by signing up and starting to write on social sites.

Excellent user experience is what we got in web2. But with web3, this is not the case.

Web3 is still in its infancy and hence UX we are getting is not what we are used to.

With that being said, this is the end of this thread.
