1/ Blockchain

As the term suggests, "Chain of Blocks.

Blockchain is decentralized database that contains data maintained across a peer-to-peer network of computers.

2/ Crypto

Crypto/Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is not controlled by any central authority (bank).

Crypto operators on distributed public ledgers which are nothing but blockchains.

3/ Public Ledger
