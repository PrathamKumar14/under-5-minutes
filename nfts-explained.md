#### I bet, no one has ever explained NFTs simpler than this (must read)

Let me explain in a way that a 5 year old child might understand.

Imagine you have a special digital toy that you really like. With an NFT, you can own that toy and nobody else can play with.

And you owning that unique toy means it helps others recognize you as the cutest and luckiest kid ever. It is now tied to your identity.

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or asset.

They are built on blockchain technology that records transactions and ensures the authenticity and security of the assets it tracks.

NFTs challenge traditional ideas about ownership and value.

They allow for the creation and ownership of digital assets, which were previously seen as intangible and therefore not able to be owned.

NFTs also open up new possibilities for creators and artists.

This allows for the creation of a new economy for digital art and other creative works.

NFTs are created using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code.

When a buyer purchases an NFT, the smart contract automatically transfers ownership of the asset to the buyer and records the transaction on the blockchain.

One of the key benefits of using NFTs is their ability to verify the authenticity and ownership of a digital asset.

Because they are stored on the blockchain, it is virtually impossible to counterfeit an NFT or claim ownership of an NFT that you do not truly own.

NFTs have the potential to revolutionize the way we think about and value digital assets.

NFTs are already being used in a variety of industries, including art, gaming, and collectibles.

Why some NFTs are so expensive?

As for the hype around certain NFTs, such as the "Monkey Selfie" NFT that sold for almost $700,000, there are a few factors at play.

Limited edition nature of NFTs, which can make them attractive to collectors.

Another reason is the perceived value of the asset itself - in this case, the "Monkey Selfie" was a viral internet meme that gained significant cultural significance, which may have contributed to its high sale price.

The high price of a certain NFT is not necessarily driven by technical factors, but rather by subjective factors.

As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for NFTs in the future.
